# Permissionless Software Foundation Project Lifecycle

## Project Definition

The PSF hosts several "Top-Level Projects." These projects are autonomous from each other and governed by their own TC (Technical Committee) and chartered by the PSF TSC.

Projects are free to create "Working Groups" which are autonomous groups collaborating to fulfill a set of responsibilities. Working Groups are eventually chartered by the TC. The TSC also charters its own Working Groups.

```
 TSC
  |
  |-- Project A TC (Chartered By TSC)
  |       |-- Working Group (Chartered By Project TC)
  |
  |-- Project B TC (Chartered By TSC)
  |       |-- Working Group (Chartered By Project TC)
  |
  |-- Working Group A (Chartered by TSC)
  |-- Working Group B (Chartered by TSC)
```

Both TLPs and TSC WGs may elect a representative to the TSC. TLPs and WGs with *incubation* status are not granted voting privileges on the TSC.
