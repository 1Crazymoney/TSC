# Technical Steering Committee (TSC) Charter

## Section 1. Guiding Principle.

The Permissionless Software Foundation strives to operate transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be
open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

The Permissionless Software Foundation asires to become a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DOA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. It uses the [PSF token](https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch/token/38e97c5d7d3585a2cbf3f9580c82ca33985f9cb0845d4dcce220cb709f9538b0) to incentivize contributions to PSF Core projects and initiatives. The token is backed by users and [stakeholders](https://t.me/psf_vip) of the token.


## Section 2. Evolution of PSF Governance.

Most large, complex open source communities have both a business and a
technical governance model. Technical leadership for the projects
within the Permissionless Software Foundation is delegated to the
Technical Steering Committee (“TSC”). Business and community governance is delegated to the Community Committee ("CommComm").

This Technical Steering Committee Charter reflects a carefully
constructed, balanced role for the TSC and the PSF stakeholders in the governance of
the Permissionless Software Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the TSC to
propose changes using simple majority of the full TSC, the proposed
changes being subject to review and approval by a vote of stakeholders via a SLP token air-drop.

Large stakeholders may request amendments to the TSC charter at any time, through the [PSF VIP Telegram room](https://t.me/psf_vip), though individual stakeholders are not allowed to interfere with day-to-day discussions, votes or meetings of the TSC.

## Section 3. Establishment of the TSC.

TSC memberships are not time-limited. There is no maximum size of the TSC.
The size is expected to vary in order to ensure adequate coverage of important
areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently.
The TSC must have at least three members, and each member must maintain a Merit
value of 30,000.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TSC
membership beyond these rules. The TSC may add additional members to the
TSC by a standard TSC motion and vote. A TSC member may be removed from the
TSC by voluntary resignation, by a standard TSC motion, or in accordance to the
participation rules described below.

Changes to TSC membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested
as any other agenda item.

No more than one-fourth of the TSC members may be affiliated with the
same employer. If removal or resignation of a TSC member, or a change of
employment by a TSC member, creates a situation where more than
one-fourth of the TSC membership shares an employer, then the situation
must be immediately remedied by the resignation or removal of one or more
TSC members affiliated with the over-represented employer(s).

The TSC may, at its discretion, invite any number of non-voting observers to
participate in the public portion of TSC discussions and meetings.

The TSC shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the
community (e.g. weekly on Zoom, or through any other
appropriate means selected by the TSC). The meeting shall be directed by
the TSC Chairperson. Responsibility for directing individual meetings may be
delegated by the TSC Chairperson to any other TSC member. Minutes or an
appropriate recording shall be taken and made available to the community
through accessible public postings.

TSC members are expected to regularly participate in TSC activities.

In the case where an individual TSC member -- within any three month period --
attends fewer than 25% of the regularly scheduled meetings, does not
participate in TSC discussions, *and* does not participate in TSC votes, the
member shall be automatically removed from the TSC. The member may be invited
to continue attending TSC meetings as an observer.

## Section 4. Responsibilities of the TSC.  

The TSC is responsible for all technical development within the PSF,
including:

* Setting release dates.
* Release quality standards.
* Technical direction.
* Project governance and process (including this policy).
* GitHub repository hosting.
* Conduct guidelines.
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.
* Development process and any coding standards.
* Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators or Foundation
projects.

## Section 5. PSF Project Operations.

The TSC will establish and maintain a development process for PSF Core
projects. The development process will establish guidelines
for how the developers and community will operate. It will, for example,
establish appropriate timelines for TSC review (e.g. agenda items must be
published at least a certain number of hours in advance of a TSC
meeting).

## Section 6. Elections

Leadership roles in the PSF will be peer elected by representatives of the community. The TSC will elect from amongst voting TSC members a TSC Chairperson to work on building an agenda for TSC meetings.

**This section to be filled in with more information.**

## Section 7. Voting

For internal project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under [Lazy
Consensus][]. The TSC shall establish appropriate guidelines for
implementing Lazy Consensus (e.g. expected notification and review time
periods) within the development process.

The TSC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When an agenda
item has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask "Does anyone
object?" as a final call for dissent from the consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a TSC member can call for
either a closing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting.
The call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the TSC or else the
discussion will continue.

For all votes, a simple majority of all TSC members for, or against, the issue
wins. A TSC member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.

Note that, in addition to requiring a simple majority vote of the TSC, all
changes to this charter are also subject to a vote of approval by [PSF Stakeholders](https://t.me/psf_vip).

## Section 8. Project Roles

The PSF git repository is maintained by the TSC and
additional Collaborators who are added by the TSC on an ongoing basis.

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions,
“Contributor(s)”, are made Collaborators and given commit-access to the
project. These individuals are identified by the TSC and their addition
as Collaborators is discussed during a TSC meeting. Modifications of the
contents of the git repository are made on a collaborative basis as defined in
the development process.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial
modifications, or modifications that have not found consensus to the TSC
for discussion by assigning the `tsc-agenda` tag to a pull request or
issue. The TSC should serve as the final arbiter where required. The TSC
will maintain and publish a list of current Collaborators, as
well as a development process guide for Collaborators and Contributors
looking to participate in the development effort.

## Section 9. Definitions

* **Contributors**: contribute code or other artifacts, but do not have
the right to commit to the code base. Contributors work with the
project’s Collaborators to have code committed to the code base. A
Contributor may be promoted to a Collaborator by the TSC. Contributors should
rarely be encumbered by the TSC and never by the [PSF Stakeholders](https://t.me/psf_vip).

* **Project**: a technical collaboration effort, e.g. a subsystem, that
is organized through the project creation process and approved by the
TSC.

* **PSF Stakeholders**: People who have gained enough Merit to in the [PSF VIP Telegram room](https://t.me/psf_vip) have demonstrated that they have skin-in-the-game, and therefore, their opinions are worth consideration by the TSC.
